## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flex box, grid
- css animation

### What I learned

- I learned how to use test driven development to test the logic when writing code.
- using jest to test with babel.
- try to separate dom element and the logic.
- combining hashmap and array for data structure.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about test driven development and mock function in jest.

### Useful resources

[https://jestjs.io/] - useful to set up jest and explain different api for test.
